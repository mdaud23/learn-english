### == Sentences With Inverted Subjects and Verbs ==

Biasanya kita menemukan ada pembalikan pada question form, misalnya

He can go to the movies -> Can he go to the movies?

You would tell me the truth -> Would you tell me the truth

She was sick yesterday -> Was she sick yesterday?

Dan untuk yang gada helping verb, maka helping verb do is used

He goes to the movies -> does he go to the movies?

You told me the truth -> Did you tell me the truth?

Subject dan verb akan dibalik pada situasi seperti:
(1) with question verbs such as what, when, where, why, and how
(2) after some place expressions;
(3) after negative expressions;
(4) in some conditionals; and
(5) after some comparisons

#### Skill 15: Invert the Subject and Verb with Question Words

- When the question word introduces a question, the subject and verb are inverted

- When the question word connects two clauses, the subject and verb that follow are not inverted

#### Skill 16: Invert the Subject and Verb with Place Expressions

Here is the book that you lent me - There are the keys that I though I lost - Nowhere have I seen such beautiful weather

In the closet are the clothes that you want - Around the corner is Sam's house - Beyond the mountains lies the town where you will live

_note_ It is important to understand that the subject and verb will invert after place exp at the beginning of a sentence only when the place exp is
necessary to complete the sentence

in the forest are many exotic birds - in the forest I walked for many hours

> place (necessary) V S

> Place (extra) S V

doesn't matter ada koma atau ngga, tetep harus gitu susunannya
