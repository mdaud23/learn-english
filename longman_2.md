#### Skill 11: Use Adjective Clause Connectors Correctly

> An adjective clause is a clause that describes a noun

`The woman is filling the glass _that she put on the table_`

`The glass _that she put on the table_ contains milk`

**Adjective clause connector**: whom (for people), which (for things), that (for people or things)

#### Skill 12: Use Adjective Clause Connector/Subjects Correctly

> Adjective clause bisa untuk menjelaskan subject atau bahkan menjadi subject juga

`The Notebook which is on the table has four sections`

`The salesclerk ran after the woman who had left her credit card in the store`

**Adjective clause connector**: who (for people), which (for things), that (for people or things)

### == Sentence With Reduced Clauses ==

It is possible in English for a clause to appear in a complete form or in a reduced form

`My friend should be on the train _which is arriving at the station now_`

`Although _it was_ not really difficult, the exam took a lot of time`

#### Skill 13: Use Reduced Adjective Clauses Correctly

Adjective clauses can appear in a reduced form. In the reduced form, the adjective clause connector 
and the be-verb that directly follow it are omitted.

> The woman who is waving to us is the tour guide -> The woman waving to us is the tour guide

> The pitcher that is on the table is full of iced tea -> The pitcher on the table is full of iced tea

an adjective clause can only be reduced if the connector is also a subject

> The woman that I just met is the tour guide (does not reduce)

Another example:

The white house, which is located in Washington, is the home of the president -> The white house, located in Washington, is the home of the president
-> Located in Washington, the White House is the home of the president

please note that cuma ada v-ing dan past participle untuk reduced form. Please note juga ketika dia v-ing itu sebagai pelaku, dan ketika past participle itu dia sebagai diperlakukan

#### Skill 14: Use Reduced Adverb Clauses Correctly

> Although he feels rather sick, the speaker will take part in the seminar -> Although feeling rather sick, the speaker will take part in the seminar

> When you give your speech, you should speak loudly and distinctly -> When giving your speech, you should speak loudly and distinctly

> Although he is rather unwell, the speaker will take part in the seminar -> Although rather unwell, the speaker will take part in the seminar

> When you are ready, you can begin your speech

please note that cuma ada v-ing dan past participle untuk reduced form. Please note juga ketika dia v-ing itu sebagai pelaku, dan ketika past participle itu dia sebagai diperlakukan
