#### Skill 11: Use Adjective Clause Connectors Correctly

> An adjective clause is a clause that describes a noun

`The woman is filling the glass _that she put on the table_`

`The glass _that she put on the table_ contains milk`

**Adjective clause connector**: whom (for people), which (for things), that (for people or things)
