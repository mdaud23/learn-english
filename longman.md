#### Skill 5: Be Careful of Past Participles
> A past participle often ends In -ed, but there are also many Irregular past participles. For many
verbs, including -ed verbs, the simple past and the past participle are the same and can be easily
confused. The -ed form of the verb can be (1) the simple past, (2) the past participle of a
verb, or (3) an adjective.

> Next, you need to check that the various clause in the sentence are correctly joined.

> Coordinate connectors need a comma in between the clauses.
> The coordinate connectors are: _and, but, or, so, yet_

> Harus bermakna dan nyambung, jangan lupa kelengkapan subject dan verb juga

`Tom must write the letter, or Paul will do it.`

#### Skill 9: Use Noun Clause Connector Correctly

> A noun clause is a clause that functions as a noun
