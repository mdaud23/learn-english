# Part 1: Grammar Basics

## Chapter 1 

### 1 Using Past, Present, and Future Tense at the Right Times

> Past tense tells what happened at a specific, previous time or describe a pattern of behavior in the past

> Present tense tells you what's going on now at the present moment, or more generally speaking, what action is recurring

> Future tense moves into fortune-teller land

Fashion is important to David, so he **always selects** the latest and most popular style: meskipun setelah always, infinitive tetap ada -s

Two minutes after receiving the award, Diane **placed** it on a shelf next to her “Best Dressed, Considering” medal: Two minutes after mengindikasikan past, tergantung konteks lah ya 

Note: Perhatikan akhiran -s; Perhatikan beda present dan present progressive

### Putting Perfect Tenses in The Spotlight

> Past perfect places on event in the past before another event in the past

Mike **had dumped** his dirty laundry in his mother's basement long before she **decided** to change the front-door lock

> Present perfect links the past and the present by describing an action or state of being that began in the past and is still going on

Kristin has been living within two miles of the Scottish border for the last decade

> Future perfect implies a deadline sometime in the future

Before sundown, David will have toasted several dozen loaves of bread

Note: Penting untuk perhatikan bahwa apakah past perlu disambung dengan saat ini, atau memang dua-duanya past
